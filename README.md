# Image Format Converter

This Python script recursively scans the current directory and its subdirectories to convert image files between JPG and PNG formats using the Python Imaging Library (PIL). If a `.jpg` file is found, it is converted to `.png`, and if a `.png` file is found, it is converted to `.jpg`.

## Features

- Automatically detects `.jpg` and `.png` images
- Converts:
  - `.jpg` ➝ `.png`
  - `.png` ➝ `.jpg`
- Maintains image quality with RGB color mode
- Recursive directory traversal

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `Pillow` library

## Installation

Install Pillow using pip:

```bash
pip install Pillow

Let me know if you want the script and README bundled together or want to turn this into a GitHub-style project!
